		<h2>Why MAML is Model-Agnostic</h2>

		<p>
			In the following figure you can find a selection of meta-learning methods
			that tackle
			few-shot
			learning, their performance on <i>omniglot</i> as well as your own accuracy score from the starting page.
			Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (short: "MAML", marked in <span style="color: #d62728">red</span>)
			is the only one among the above methods that falls under the category of
			<i>optimization-based meta-learning</i> and it will be our main interest in the rest of the article.

				<p>Results of different methods on the omniglot dataset
					(if not stated differently: 1-shot, 20-way;
					some differences in the evaluation procedure exist).
					As usual, accuracy numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt as
					differences in the evaluation method, implementation, and the model
					complexity may a have a non-negligible impact on the performance.
				</p>
				<p id="caption_generative_stroke_model" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					The generative stroke model was introduced in the paper which also
					introduced omniglot. The model is based on a latent stroke representation
					(including the number and directions of strokes). While it is an
					interesting approach, it can hardly be generalized to other
					few-shot problems.<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/cogsci/LakeSGT11"></d-cite>
				</p>
				<p id="caption_hierachical_bayesian_program_learning" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					The same authors improved the model by learning latent
					primitive motor elements and called this process "Hierarchial
					Bayesian Program Learning" (HBPL).
					While the accuracy was greatly increased, it also
					is focused on symbol learning.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="lake_one-shot_2013"></d-cite>
				</p>
				<p id="caption_siamese_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Siames Nets consist of two identical networks which produce a latent representation.
					From the representations of two samples, a distance is calculated to
					assess the similarity of the two samples.<d-cite bibtex-key="koch_siamese_2015"></d-cite>
					The result (accuracy of 88.1%) results from a reimplementaion of the method which
					makes it more comparable.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="vinyals_matching_2017"></d-cite>
				</p>
				<p id="caption_matching_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Matching Networks also work by comparing new samples to labeled
					examples. They do so by utilizing an attention kernel.
					Though the second version of the paper is cited here,
					it was first published in 2016.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="vinyals_matching_2017"></d-cite>
				</p>

				<p id="caption_prototypical_networks" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Prototypical Networks use prototype vectors to represent each class
					in the metric space. The nearest neighbor (i.e. the closest prototype)
					of a sample then determines the prediction.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="snell_prototypical_2017"></d-cite>
				</p>

				<p id="caption_memory_augmented_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Memory-Augmented Networks (MANNs) use an external memory to make accurate
					predictions using a small number of samples.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="santoro_meta-learning_2016"></d-cite>
				</p>

				<p id="caption_meta_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Meta Networks utilize a base learner (task level) and a meta learner
					as well as a set of slow and rapid weights in order to allow
					meta learning as well as task-specific concepts.

			In this section we will find out why MAML is "model-agnostic" and thereby gain a bit more of an overview over the 
			meta-learning field.
			We start by taking a look at how few-shot problems are tackeled by other meta-learning approaches.
			As opposed to the optimization-based MAML, these methods force constraints on either the samples or the meta-learning architecture 
			and can thus separated into
			metric-based and model-based approaches respectively.

		<h4>Metric-based approaches</h4>
		<p>
			The core idea of metric-based approaches is to compare two samples in a
			latent (metric) space: In this space, samples of the same class are supposed
			to be close to each other, while two samples from different classes are
			supposed to have a large distance (the notion of a distance is what makes
			the latent space a metric space).
			<d-cite bibtex-key="snell_prototypical_2017"></d-cite>
			<d-cite bibtex-key="koch_siamese_2015"></d-cite>
			<d-cite bibtex-key="vinyals_matching_2017"></d-cite>
		</p>

		<h4>Model-based approaches</h4>
		<p>
			Model-based approaches are neural architectures which are deliberately designed
			for fast adaption to new tasks without an inclination to overfit.
			Memory-Augmented Neural Networks and MetaNet are two examples. Both employ
			an external memory while still maintaining the ability to be trained
			end-to-end.
			<d-cite bibtex-key="santoro_meta-learning_2016"></d-cite>
			<d-cite bibtex-key="munkhdalai_meta_2017"></d-cite>
		</p>

		<h4>optimization-based approach (MAML)</h4>
		<p>
			MAML goes a different route: The neural network is designed the same way
			your usual model might be (in the many-shot case). All the magic happens during the
			optimization, which is what makes it "optimization-based".
			As a consequence, unlike metric-based and model-based approaches, MAML lets
			you choose the model architecture freely.
			This has the great benefit of being applicable not only to
			conventional supervised learning classification tasks but also
			to reinforcement learning
			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the <a href="maml.html">the next section</a> we will take a close look at MAML and study the math behind the method.
			Furthermore, you will get the chance to explore a simple few-shot learning problem and find out first hand why a meta-learning 
			approach is needed to solve it. All of that within your browser!
